<h1>Creating Texture Inspector Tools</h1>
<p>
  Creating a tool for the texture inspector is very easy. You just need to write a short .js file and then host it somewhere online; I have been using GH Pages for this purpose.
  
  Here is a sample tool file: <a href="./Paintbrush.js">Paintbrush.js</a>. You can load this tool into the editor by clicking the "add tool" button, and then pasting in that URL and clicking add.

  The important things to note:
  <ol>
    <li>the .js file must be structured as _TOOL_DATA_ = {...your tool data...}.</li>
    <li>You must define a name (string), type (class), and icon (base 64 encoded SVG icon.</li>
    <li>There are two optional properties. usesWindow if you want a GUI window and is3D if you want to use post processes.</li>
    <li>The class must have a constructor, which should save the function getParameters to a member variable. getParameters returns the tools API in the form of an object.</li>
    <li>The class must have a setup() function which is called <b>when the tool is selected in the toolbar</b>.</li>
    <li>The class must have a cleanup() function which is called <b>when the tool is deselected</b>.</li>
    <li>You must call updateTexture() after you make any changes to the texture. (which is a member of getParameters())</li>
    <li>2D tools can use the canvas API to paint on the texture.</li>
    <li>3D tools must create post processes or otherwise modify scene3D.</li>
